Greetings, I'm Yahchayil. 👋
I'm a senior technologist, educator, conference speaker, athlete, and event organizer currently living near Denver, Colorado; and working on distributed key management for blockchain networks.

Professional Interests 💼
Teaching is a passion, both as a speaker or one-on-one. Subjects of interest include reverse engineering, network security, radio transmitter hunting, public safety communications, and graphics rendering. I can trace my interest in engineering and education to the Amateur Radio study group I formed with several friends in middle school, which resulted in most of us earning our licenses, myself included.

Today, I continue that tradition of sharing knowledge by authoring technical blog entries, working to build communities through events, and mentoring the next generation of responsible engineers at local makerspaces. 🤝

Offline 🌄 🚴‍♂️
When offline, I enjoy a number of outdoor sports, including riding my Catrike Dumont recumbent cycle, running, and hiking the beautiful Rocky Mountains with my family.

Have a question? 🔍
My primary development environment is Visual Studio Code (with the Vim extension), usually running on my M1 Max MacBook Pro. When at the desk, I use a Voyager keyboard from ZSA with Kailh Choc Brown switches. ⌨️
